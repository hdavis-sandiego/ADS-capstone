# ADS: Capstone

This project is a part of the ADS-599 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. 

## Project Status: [Completed]

## Installation
Clone the github repo onto your machine and download the relevant data files from MSHA's Mine Data Retrieval systems. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The main goal of this study is to help MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) determine if a mining violation is significant or substantial, meaning that an accident occurs after a violation has been cited. To do this, various classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, naïve bayes, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and support vector machine (SVM) are trained and tuned. The output is the probability of a future accident occurring 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days after a violation has been given.
